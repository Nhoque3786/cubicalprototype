## First things first...
- [ ] Remake the camera inside the player.gd
- [ ] **Instead of the camera rotating, the map itself should rotate**

- [ ] Fix orientation.gd
- [ ] Add a script for world params

## Testing
- [ ] Add a better testing map that test player movement too

- [ ] Prototype "Hyperjump" (Basically a dash)

## Mechanics
- [ ] Add Bits and Bytes (colectables) for testing
- [ ] Add Climbables

## Engine
- [ ] Find a way to make .xm .it .mod files work as dynamic music inside it as nodes
