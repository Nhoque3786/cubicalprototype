# Cubical: Kinda like a FEZ spiritual sucessor, made on godot. (Or some thing like that)
## Prototype Edition! 
This amazing project is for a game i'm making for learning how to make games and 100% pure for the love i have for the concept the original game has. 

This is the Prototype Edition, made to launch as a webgame on NG and to experiment with the idea of a 2d/3d game. Full game will be in the works after this is done and i get permission from Polytron. More info about what it is and it's todo, check [here](https://github.com/Nhoque3786/cubicalprototype/wiki/Prototype-Edition!)
